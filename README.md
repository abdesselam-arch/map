A Flutter application for Android and iOS, designed to provide invaluable support and guidance to residents of Abu Dhabi for their daily transportation needs. This innovative app offers users a variety of route options, utilizing different modes of transportation to make their journeys to their desired destinations as smooth as possible. The app not only suggests multiple routes but also recommends the optimal one by taking into account various factors such as weather conditions, the user's health status, travel duration, and the purpose of the trip in relation to the chosen mode of transportation. To achieve these goals, the app harnesses the power of a set of third-party APIs. What sets this new version apart from the previous one developed by Miss. HALA HECHMANE is that the application is now usable on Android and IOS, as well as its utilization of a new set of APIs. It now incorporates the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather conditions and the Graphhopper API for route suggestions and mapping services. Moreover, the app ensures the continuous monitoring of Android users' health data through HealthConnect, an Android SDK that aggregates health information from various sources into a real-time database. For iOS users, their health data is monitored using HealthKit, Apple's solution for storing, managing, and sharing health data, which is a departure from the older version that solely relied on HealthConnect. In addition to these improvements, the user interface has been enhanced to feature a robust account management system with Firebase Authentication, covering tasks such as login, signup, and password changes. The user interface is now highly customizable and offers easy access to the search page, allowing users to swiftly make consecutive route requests. The application is now accessible in multiple languages, including Arabic, French, and English accompanied with a range of color themes to suit individual preferences. In future updates, the app will continue to learn from user preferences and choices, providing a tailored experience based on the collected data regarding users' route preferences.
